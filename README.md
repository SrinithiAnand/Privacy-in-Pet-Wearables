# Privacy in Pet Wearables: Comparative Policy Analysis (2019–2025)

This project reviews privacy policies for 10 pet wearables and evaluates
(1) owner vs pet data collection, (2) clarity/transparency, and (3) GDPR/CCPA alignment.

## Why this matters
Pet devices frequently collect data that can indirectly profile owners.
We benchmark transparency and user rights and propose practical fixes.

## What’s included
- /paper/  → Research paper (PDF)
- /poster/ → One-page results poster
- /tables/ → Comparison tables (compliance, data types, rights)
- /summary/→ 1-minute takeaways (README section)

## Key findings (high level)
- ~70% mention GDPR; only ~30% clearly explain deletion/account rights.
- Owner data consistently outweighs pet data across products.
- Some GPS devices don’t explicitly disclose location collection.
- Recommendations: privacy labels, clearer rights workflows, treat “pet data” as indirectly personal.

## Methods
Qualitative content analysis with a six-dimension coding frame:
data types, clarity, user rights, legal references, security/sharing, breach context.

## Suggested future work
Automated policy diffing (NLP), larger sample, and user-study on label comprehension.
